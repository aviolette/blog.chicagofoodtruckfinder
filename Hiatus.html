<div>Dear Food Truck Owners,</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The data that gets put on my site is collected by your twitter feeds,@uchinomgo’s twitter feeds, google calendar feeds, emails, websites, etc. Some of it is collected automatically (via twitter parsing and reading your public calendars) and a lot of it is added by me sleuthing around on your websites.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I will be out of the country for a week with no access to internet (from March 22-29). During this time I will be tightening up how stops get placed on my site as to avoid bad data getting added. I could really use your help to assure that during this time truck stops get added correctly. Here are some things you could do to help me (also see this):</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>1) From March 22 – 29th, you need to use the hashtag #ftf whenever you specify a location on twitter otherwise your stop will not get added to my site or included in any of the tweets to my chiftf_ twitter accounts. So instead of this:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We will be at Clark and Monroe for lunch today</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>do this:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We will be at Clark and Monroe for lunch today #ftf</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>See, that was easy.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>2) Try to avoid using two locations in one tweet, for example</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Sorry Adams and Wacker, we are at Clark and Monroe #ftf</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>My site isn’t that smart and will pick the first location it finds, so it will put your stop at Adams and Wacker. Ordinarily I’ll spot a tweet like this and correct it on my site, but I’m not going to be here.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>3) Try to use times. “11-1:30pm” or “until 3:00” or something like that. If you are a lunch truck and don’t specify times, I just assume you are going to be at a spot for two hours from 11:30 to 1:30 (ok it’s a bit more complicated than that, but that’s the basic gist)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>4) If you want to take all your stops off my site for a day, just use “off the road” in a tweet (currently, this sends me an email which validates that that is your actual intention before I click a button and have your stops removed, but during this week my site will just remove all of your stops)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>5) I currently manually add your schedules I get in email or day-of on twitter. My site will not add your schedule stops for the day while I’m gone. If you want to post an advance schedule, use a public google calendar and send me the URL to it. Currently Flirty Cupcakes, Chicago Pizza Boss, Baby Cakes, and Cupcake Gangsters are the only trucks that do this.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Thanks again and let me know if you have any questions</div>
