<div>Spent the train ride into work today writing <a href="https://github.com/aviolette/ninjaeyes">some Node.js code</a> that sets the eye color on my Ninjablock based on how many food trucks are currently on the road in Chicago. Backup…what? Ninjablocks are awesome little computers running ubuntu that you can attach to wireless sensors and actuators in your house. You can query the sensors and actuators using a basic REST API. They also have cool little eyes, which you can programmatically change the colors on.</div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>I set this code to run on a cron job every 15 minutes. It queries the Chicago Food Truck Finder via its rest API for the current trucks on the road, then sets the lights accordingly.</div>

<div>If you’d like to build something on top of the food truck finder, let me know, I’ll give you an application key. I may eventually require oauth credentials, but not yet.</div>
