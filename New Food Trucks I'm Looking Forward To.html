<div>To me, spring always means new food trucks are hitting the streets (and the return of trucks that hibernated in the winter. Â Where are you Windy City Patty Wagon?!). Â </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Both the Chicago Lunchbox and The Fat Shallot have told me they are working on new food trucks that hopefully will come out in April. Â  The Fat Shallot's will be deli concept called The Fat Pickle. Â </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The other day I was scanning the City of Chicago Data portal and also noticed that Bob Cha just had a second truck recently licensed. Â As a side note, about four-of-five mobile licenses are for ice cream and paleterias. Â Why do I never see any of these?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Finally, there will be a new Hot Dog food truck called the <a href="http://hotdogfiend.com/">Hot Dog Fiend</a>Â that will be launching soon. Â A New Yorker-owned hot dog vendor might not be so religious about ketchup <span style="-evernote-sentoj-emoticon:true">ðŸ˜‰</span><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I will Â update this space if I find anything new!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>UpdateÂ Friday, March 18, 2016Â </b></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I recently found out about <a href="http://bopbartruck.com/">Bop Bar</a>, which looks to be a food truck that sells korean food. Â When I find out more information about when this truck will open, I will post here.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Update Monday, March 28, 2016</b></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>There is a new suburban food truck called <a href="http://www.chicagofoodtruckfinder.com/trucks/grumpygaucho">Grumpy Gaucho</a> which sells empanadas.</div>
