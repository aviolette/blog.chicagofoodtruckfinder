title: Weekend of October 26th
---
Just thought I’d call your attention to a few things going on this weekend.
1) The DePaul Big East Kick-off Party will be under the L tracks near Sheffield and Belden on Friday, October 25th starting at 6pm. It will feature the food from these fine food trucks:
    * Giordano’s Pizza
    * Haute n’ Ready
    * The Fat Shallot
    * Sweet Ride
    * The Salsa Truck
2) The Food Truck Extravaganza in Schaumburg is at the Boomer’s Stadium on Saturday from 11-7 and features 15 trucks including:
    * Babycakes
    * Beyond Borders
    * Brand BBQ
    * Bridgeport Pasty
    * Calle Wagon
    * Chicago Cupcake
    * Chicago Pizza Boss
    * Gia Via Sweets
    * La Adelita
    * Mariani’s Gelato Italiano
    * Pierogi Wagon
    * Stixx Grille
    * Tamale Spaceship
    * Toasty Cheese
    * Windy City Patty Wagon
    This should be a great event!
3) The last outdoor Nosh Chicago will be in the backlot of the AN Pritzker School (2007 West Schiller) on Saturday from 10-5. The only food truck I know that will be there is Carbon’s Golden Malted Waffle Truck, but there will be many other food vendors there.
4) Finally, Southport and Addison has become the weekend hotspot for food trucks. On Saturday, The Doughnut Vault Food Truck will be there in the morning, and Eastman Egg will be there Sunday Morning. That’s some serious goodness from two of my favorite food trucks.
