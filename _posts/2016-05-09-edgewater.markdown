title: Edgewater Beach Food Truck Fridays
---
Every Friday during the summer, the Edgewater Beach Development Corporation will be hosting a rotating selection of food trucks (with Da Pizza Dude and La Patrona being semi-permanent fixtures).  I will be posting the lineup for the week on my website when I know it.
