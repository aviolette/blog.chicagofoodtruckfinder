You may encounter an issue with The Chicago Food Truck Finder iPhone application running on iOS 9.0 where initially after launch it displays “There are no food trucks currently on the road”. This is due to a race condition upon startup that prevents a refresh. The work around until I get a fix in the App Store, is to just pull down on the list to force a refresh.

Update 10/11/2015

This has been fixed with version 1.1.1 => [https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/chicago-food-truck-finder/id1002801516](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/chicago-food-truck-finder/id1002801516)
