title: New Food Trucks I'm Looking Forward To
---

To me, spring always means new food trucks are hitting the streets (and the return of trucks that hibernated in the winter.  Where are you Windy City Patty Wagon?!).  

Both the Chicago Lunchbox and The Fat Shallot have told me they are working on new food trucks that hopefully will come out in April.   The Fat Shallot's will be deli concept called The Fat Pickle.  

The other day I was scanning the City of Chicago Data portal and also noticed that Bob Cha just had a second truck recently licensed.  As a side note, about four-of-five mobile licenses are for ice cream and paleterias.  Why do I never see any of these?

Finally, there will be a new Hot Dog food truck called the Hot Dog Fiend that will be launching soon.  A New Yorker-owned hot dog vendor might not be so religious about ketchup ðŸ˜‰

I will  update this space if I find anything new!

Update Friday, March 18, 2016 

I recently found out about Bop Bar, which looks to be a food truck that sells korean food.  When I find out more information about when this truck will open, I will post here.

Update Monday, March 28, 2016

There is a new suburban food truck called Grumpy Gaucho which sells empanadas.
