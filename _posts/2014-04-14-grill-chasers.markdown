Last week I had a chance to go to the launch party of a new food truck Grill Chasers. This food truck will be based in the suburbs (out of the same commissary as Toasty Cheese) and will serve up organic grilled chicken, vegetarian skewers, and comfort-food sides. I am excited to see a truck that makes food-sourcing such a core part of its mission.

My favorite items? The grilled chicken wings, homemmade BBQ sauce, and kale slaw were definitely the highlights for me.

Other tidbits of info:

* There is a new pizza truck coming soon: The Pizza Via. It will also be based out of Greg’s commissary, along with three other new trucks.
* Greg let me know that he will be debuting a new menu in early May in his Toasty Cheese truck, which will feature among other things, a duck confit poutine!!!
* There will be a monthly food truck festival in the Burbs.  See here for more information
