title: Chrome Extension Update (version 1.0)
---


I updated my food truck notifier chrome extension to support New York City.  If you are in NYC, it will notify you of nearby food trucks.  If you are in Chicago, it will continue to notify you of nearby Chicago food trucks.

If you have previously installed it, you may need to re-enable it, since I had to add some additional browser access to get it to work in NYC.
