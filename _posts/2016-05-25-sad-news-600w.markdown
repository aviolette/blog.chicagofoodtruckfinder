title: Sad news about 600 West Chicago
---
Food trucks are getting word that the lot across from 600 West Chicago Avenue (Groupon's Headquarters) will be closing May 31st.  This has been where food trucks have parked since Alderman "Food Trucks are a Privilege" Burnett [removed the food truck parking zone in 2014](https://www.facebook.com/chicagofoodtruckfinder/posts/888938544453095).  

Some food trucks, such as the Corner Farmacy will try to park on Chicago Avenue near Chase Bank next week.  Hopefully this will be successful and food trucks will still be part of the 600 W community.

I will keep you all posted on developments.
