title: Winter is Coming
---

Winter is coming and with it some food trucks will go into hibernation for the winter. The reasons include less business and the difficulty of operating a truck in colder weather (especially cook on-board trucks).

During this time I know some trucks will be partnering with Fooda to serve their food in pop-ups.

These are the trucks that have indicated to me that they will be off the road fully or partially during the winter:

* Bruges Brothers (already off the road)
* Chicago Pizza Boss
* The Corner Farmacy (January/February)
* Husky Hog BBQ
* Tony’s Kitchen & Co. – reconcepting (January/February)
* Marios Cart (burbs)
* The Slide Ride
* Milts BBQ Truck (maybe)
