title: 20 Dollar Donut
---

A couple days ago, I read about the 20 dollar donut being sold at Do-Rite Donuts and being the donut adventurer I am, I had to take the plunge.

There are some things you should know that most articles Iâ€™ve read do not tell you:

1) They donâ€™t have these donuts in the display case. They have to call the chef up on the Batphoneâ„¢ to prepare that bad-ass. He comes up with a kit, that has a wrapped truffle (which he encouraged me to smell), New Zealand salt, a block of chocolate, truffle oil, and an olive wood shaver to shave the truffle with. The rest of the people in line donâ€™t know WTF is going on, â€˜cause this is donut theater that takes place right there. This production made me feel a bit guilty that I was spending $20 on a donutâ€¦but I got over it ðŸ˜ƒ

2) He starts with a basic raised donut that they do have in the display case, drizzles truffle oil on it, salts it, shaves chocolate, and the final piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance, the shaved truffles (ok it might not have been exactly in that order, but thatâ€™s what you get). See the beautiful picture on Zagatâ€™s website (Itâ€™s better than the one I took).

3) Because of the truffle oil, these donuts have a very limited lifespan. So donâ€™t expect to eat it in an hour, â€˜cause it will be soggy. In the end, I walked over to The Fat Shallot a few blocks a way and shared the donut with Sarah and crew.

This donut was delicious, and I love Do-Rite. That said, I think this will be the last time I spend that amount on a donut.
