<div>Hello interwebz…</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>My name is Andrew Violette and I run <a href="http://www.chicagofoodtruckfinder.com/">The Chicago Food Truck Finder</a>. I created this project over 2 years ago because I wanted the Chicago food trucks’ current and future locations displayed on a map. My mission has always been to do that with the greatest accuracy possible. I really think I’m only about 50% of the way there. My website scans and parses twitter for trucks’ location and time data, scans food trucks’ google calendars and automatically adds events to my site, has a beaconing tool that food trucks can use to update their location, and even automatically crowd-sources tough-to-locate trucks (Thanks @uchinomgo). Every morning, I spend some time manually entering schedule data that falls outside of those automatic ways trucks can add their schedule.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Despite all that, I still have incorrect data show up on my website from time to time. I think I have done everything technically that I can do to have it show up correctly, but need to do a better job informing food trucks how it works and how integration can benefit them.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>In addition to my main goal of getting you accurate information about food trucks’ whereabouts, I also want to start blogging a bit more about the food truck scene. I DO NOT plan on reviewing food trucks or posting food pictures. I DO plan on trying to get the word out about events and other things of interest to people who like food trucks.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Other stuff in the Food truck finder pipeline:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<ul>
<li>Improved notifications for the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.andrewviolette.truckz">Chicago Food Truck Finder Android application</a></li>
<li>an iOS application (I am currently working on this, dispite my hatred for Objective-C)</li>
<li>a visual redesign of the site (I am currently saving some dough to make this happen)</li>
</ul>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Thanks to everyone who uses my site and thanks to all the food trucks out there for doing what you do!</div>
