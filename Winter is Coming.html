<div>Winter is coming and with it some food trucks will go into hibernation for the winter. The reasons include less business and the difficulty of operating a truck in colder weather (especially cook on-board trucks).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>During this time I know some trucks will be partnering with Fooda to serve their food in pop-ups.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>These are the trucks that have indicated to me that they will be off the road fully or partially during the winter:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<ul>
<li>Bruges Brothers (already off the road)</li>
<li>Chicago Pizza Boss</li>
<li>The Corner Farmacy (January/February)</li>
<li>Husky Hog BBQ</li>
<li>Tony’s Kitchen &amp; Co. – reconcepting (January/February)</li>
<li>Marios Cart (burbs)</li>
<li>The Slide Ride</li>
<li>Milts BBQ Truck (maybe)</li>
</ul>
