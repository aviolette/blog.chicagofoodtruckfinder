<div>I have submitted my latest update to my Chicago Food Truck Finder iPhone app to the Apple App Store. With this release, I am finally happy with the way it looks on the iPhone device. I’m not saying its “feature complete”, but the look-and-feel jives with how I like to use it. Here are some of the highlights:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<ul>
<li>Added social media links from toolbar menus on both location and truck page</li>
<li>Added contact information on truck page</li>
<li>Added banner and larger images on truck page</li>
<li>Added truck schedule for a location on the location page</li>
<li>Added navigation button on location page</li>
<li>Initial iPad support. It works on the iPad, but doesn’t look totally like a native iPad app.</li>
</ul>

<div>I will update you when this gets approved for release.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>As always, I value speed and ease of use over flashiness.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The next release I plan on building out iPad functionality, adding a trucks list, adding the ability to retrieve future schedules beyond just today, and maybe, just maybe, notifications.</div>
